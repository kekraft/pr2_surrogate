PR2 Surrogate
=============

This package enables fully immersive control of a PR2 robot using the Oculus Rift and Razer Hydra.

What it does:

How to run:
- Connect your Hydra and Oculus Rift
- On the robot: `robot start`, then `roslaunch pr2_surrogate robot.launch`
- On the desktop: `roslaunch pr2_surrogate desktop.launch`
